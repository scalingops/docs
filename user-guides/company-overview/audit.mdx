# Company Audit

The Company Audit page provides a comprehensive overview of each company's setup status and operational health within your MSPortal tenant. This centralized dashboard helps you quickly identify which companies are fully configured and which need attention.

## Setup Complete Requirements

A company achieves "Setup Complete" status when all essential configuration steps are finished. This ensures the company can fully utilize MSPortal's features.

### Required for Setup Complete

To achieve complete setup status, a company must have:

1. **At least one role assigned** - Ensures proper access control and responsibilities are defined
2. **A scheduled QBR** - Either through the business review schedule or an upcoming QBR meeting
3. **At least one user** - The company needs active users to operate
4. **At least one location** - Physical or logical locations must be defined
5. **At least one device** - Devices need to be registered for management
6. **Upcoming planner items** - Active tasks show the planner is being utilized
7. **Upcoming compliance checks** - Compliance activities scheduled for the next 30 days

## Using the Audit Page Effectively
