This guide explains how to resynchronize data between MSPortal and your PSA system when you need to refresh ticket data or resolve synchronization issues.

## Overview

The Clear and Resync feature allows you to:
- Perform a quick synchronization of recent changes
- Complete a full data refresh by clearing and reimporting all tickets
- Resolve synchronization conflicts or data inconsistencies
- Apply configuration changes that require a full resync

## When to Use Clear and Resync

### Quick Sync
Use Quick Sync when:
- Testing new configuration changes
- Updating recently modified tickets
- Resolving minor sync delays
- Refreshing data after brief connection issues

### Full Clear and Resync
Use Full Clear and Resync when:
- Initial integration setup is complete
- Major configuration changes have been made
- Data inconsistencies need to be resolved
- Switching between PSA systems
- Recovering from extended sync failures

## Prerequisites

- PSA integration must be configured and enabled
- You must have "Manage Integrations" permission
- Ensure no critical ticket updates are in progress
- Back up any local ticket data if needed

## Steps to Resync

### 1. Navigate to Integration Settings

Go to [https://msportal.ai/settings/integrations](https://msportal.ai/settings/integrations)

### 2. Access Ticket Settings

Click on **Ticket Settings** in the integration menu.

### 3. Locate Ticket Sync Options

Scroll down to the **Ticket Sync Options** section. Here you'll find two synchronization options:

### 4. Choose Sync Method

#### Option A: Quick Sync
- Click **Quick Sync** button
- Synchronizes only recent changes
- Takes 1-2 minutes typically
- Preserves existing data

#### Option B: Full Clear and Resync
- Click **Full Clear and Resync** button
- Completely removes all ticket data from MSPortal
- Reimports all tickets from the PSA system
- Takes several minutes depending on data volume

> **Warning:** Full Clear and Resync will delete all local ticket data and reimport everything from your PSA. Any unsynchronized local changes will be lost.

### 5. Wait for Completion

The synchronization process will:
- Display a progress indicator
- Show status updates as data syncs
- Notify you when complete
- May take several minutes for large datasets

## What Gets Synchronized

### Ticket Data
- Ticket details (title, description, status)
- Priority and categories
- Assigned technicians
- Company and contact associations
- Custom fields (if configured)
- Ticket notes and time entries

### Related Data
- Company information
- Contact details
- Board configurations
- Status mappings
- Priority settings

## Post-Sync Verification

After synchronization completes:

1. **Check Ticket Count:** Verify the expected number of tickets appears
2. **Review Recent Tickets:** Confirm latest tickets are present
3. **Test Updates:** Make a small change to verify two-way sync
4. **Check Mappings:** Ensure status and priority mappings are correct
5. **Verify Permissions:** Confirm users can access appropriate tickets

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Takes Too Long
- Check your internet connection
- Verify PSA system is responsive
- Consider using Quick Sync for testing
- Contact support if sync exceeds 30 minutes

### Missing Tickets After Sync
- Verify board selection in settings
- Check excluded status configurations
- Ensure date range settings are correct
- Review PSA permissions

### Sync Fails to Complete
- Check PSA API credentials
- Verify integration is enabled
- Review error logs for specific issues
- Try Quick Sync before Full Clear and Resync

### Data Inconsistencies
- Perform a Full Clear and Resync
- Check field mapping configurations
- Verify time zone settings match
- Review custom field mappings

## Best Practices

- **Schedule Full Syncs:** Perform during off-hours to minimize disruption
- **Test First:** Use Quick Sync to test configuration changes
- **Document Changes:** Note what prompted the resync for future reference
- **Monitor First Sync:** Stay available during initial synchronization
- **Regular Maintenance:** Schedule periodic full syncs (monthly/quarterly)

## Performance Considerations

### Quick Sync Performance
- Typically completes in 1-3 minutes
- Minimal system impact
- Can be run during business hours

### Full Clear and Resync Performance
- Duration depends on ticket volume:
  - < 1,000 tickets: 2-5 minutes
  - 1,000-5,000 tickets: 5-15 minutes
  - > 5,000 tickets: 15-30 minutes
- Higher system resource usage
- Best performed during maintenance windows
