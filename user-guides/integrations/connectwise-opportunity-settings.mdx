This guide explains how to configure ConnectWise Manage opportunity settings for sales and project planning integration in MSPortal.

## Overview

ConnectWise Opportunity settings control how opportunities are created and managed when using the Planner module in MSPortal. This integration allows you to:

- Set default values for new opportunities
- Map users to sales representatives
- Configure fallback assignments for non-ConnectWise users

## Prerequisites

- ConnectWise Manage integration must be enabled
- You must have "Manage Integrations" permission
- ConnectWise API must have opportunity permissions
- At least one sales representative must exist in ConnectWise

## Configuration Steps

This is important when:
- MSPortal users aren't all in ConnectWise

### 5. Map Users to Sales Representatives

Configure how MSPortal users map to ConnectWise sales representatives:

## Best Practices

### User Mapping
- Map all active sales users to ConnectWise representatives
- Use a dedicated fallback account for unmapped users
- Regular audits of user mappings
- Document any special mapping rules

### Default Values
- Set realistic default probabilities
- Use appropriate close date defaults
- Configure stages to match your sales process
- Keep opportunity types simple and clear

### Data Quality
- Require minimum fields for opportunity creation
- Validate data before syncing
- Regular cleanup of stale opportunities
- Consistent naming conventions

## Troubleshooting

### Opportunities Not Creating
- Verify ConnectWise API has opportunity permissions
- Check fallback sales rep is configured
- Ensure opportunity type is selected
- Review error logs for specific issues

### Wrong Sales Rep Assigned
- Check user mapping configuration
- Verify fallback rep settings
- Ensure ConnectWise user is active
- Review assignment rules

### Missing Required Fields
- Check ConnectWise opportunity requirements
- Verify all mandatory fields are mapped
- Review field validation rules
- Ensure data types match

### Sync Delays
- Check integration sync schedule
- Verify API connection is active
- Review system performance
- Check for API rate limits

## Common Use Cases

### Sales Team Workflow
1. Sales rep creates opportunity in Planner
2. System assigns to correct ConnectWise rep
3. Opportunity syncs with pipeline
4. Updates flow back to MSPortal

### Project Planning Integration
1. Project manager plans in MSPortal
2. Creates opportunity for approval
3. Links to ConnectWise for tracking
4. Financial data stays synchronized

### Multi-Department Coordination
1. Technical team identifies opportunity
2. Creates in Planner with details
3. Assigns to appropriate sales rep
4. Tracks progress across departments

## Security Considerations

- **API Permissions:** Limit to required opportunity fields only
- **User Access:** Control who can create opportunities
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure sensitive data is protected
- **Audit Trail:** Enable logging for opportunity creation

## Performance Tips

- **Batch Creation:** Group multiple opportunities when possible
