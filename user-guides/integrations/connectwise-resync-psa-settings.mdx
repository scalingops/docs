### 3. Wait for Synchronization

After clicking the sync button:
- The process runs automatically in the background
- Typical completion time: 1-2 minutes
- A notification will appear when complete
- The page may refresh to show updated options

## Understanding the Sync Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection (30 seconds)
The system queries ConnectWise for:
- All configuration tables
- Current settings and options
- Active records only

### Phase 2: Data Processing (20 seconds)
MSPortal processes the data:
- Compares with existing cache
- Identifies changes
- Validates data integrity

### Phase 3: Cache Update (10 seconds)
The system updates:
- Local configuration cache
- Dropdown options
- Form field choices
- Display settings

## What Doesn't Get Synchronized

The PSA Settings sync does NOT include:
- Actual ticket data (use ticket sync for this)
- Historical data or closed tickets
- User passwords or credentials
- Financial information
- Document attachments
- Time entries (unless specifically configured)

## Post-Sync Verification

After synchronization completes, verify:

### 1. Check Dropdown Options
- Go to ticket creation form
- Verify all dropdowns populate correctly
- Check that new options appear

### 2. Test Board Access
- Navigate to ticket list
- Confirm all boards are visible
- Verify board filtering works

### 3. Validate Status Mappings
- Review status dropdown in tickets
- Ensure all statuses are available
- Check status transition rules

### 4. Confirm Custom Fields
- Open a ticket template
- Verify custom fields appear
- Check field validation works

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Doesn't Start
- Verify ConnectWise integration is enabled
- Check API credentials are valid
- Ensure you have proper permissions
- Try refreshing the page first

### Missing Options After Sync
- The item may be inactive in ConnectWise
- Check ConnectWise permissions
- Verify the item meets filter criteria
- Try running sync again

### Sync Takes Too Long
- Check ConnectWise server response
- Verify network connectivity
- Large datasets may take longer
- Contact support if over 5 minutes

### Error Messages
- **API Error:** Check ConnectWise API credentials
- **Permission Denied:** Verify API key permissions
- **Timeout:** ConnectWise server may be slow
- **Invalid Data:** Data corruption, contact support

## Best Practices

### Regular Synchronization
- Schedule monthly PSA syncs
- Sync after major ConnectWise changes
- Document when syncs are performed
- Monitor for sync failures

### Change Management
- Notify users before major config changes
- Test in off-hours when possible
- Document what changed in ConnectWise
- Verify critical workflows after sync

### Performance Optimization
- Avoid syncing during peak hours
- Don't sync multiple times rapidly
- Allow sync to complete fully
- Clear browser cache after major syncs

## Common Scenarios

### Adding New Service Board
1. Create board in ConnectWise
2. Configure board settings
3. Run PSA Settings sync in MSPortal
4. Configure board in MSPortal ticket settings
5. Test ticket creation on new board

### Changing Ticket Priorities
1. Modify priorities in ConnectWise
2. Update any automation rules
3. Sync PSA settings in MSPortal
4. Verify priority mappings
5. Test priority-based workflows

### Implementing Custom Fields
1. Create custom fields in ConnectWise
2. Set field properties and validation
3. Run PSA sync in MSPortal
4. Add fields to ticket templates
5. Test field functionality

## Impact on Users

During synchronization:
- Ticket creation remains available
- Existing tickets are unaffected
- Dropdowns may briefly show old values
- No downtime or service interruption

After synchronization:
- New options appear immediately
- Removed options become unavailable
- Form layouts may adjust
- Cached pages may need refresh

## Security Considerations

- Sync only retrieves configuration data
- No sensitive data is transferred
- API permissions limit data access
- All transfers are encrypted
- Audit logs track sync activities
