# How to Enable Training

Training modules are not enabled by default in MSPortal.ai. This guide walks you through the process of enabling training courses for your organization.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator access to MSPortal.ai
- Access to the Settings module

## Checking Training Status

When you first access the Training module, you'll notice that no courses are available by default. The system will display "No courses found" until training is enabled.

## Enabling Training Courses

### Step 1: Navigate to Training Settings

1. Go to **Settings** in your MSPortal.ai dashboard
2. Select **Training** from the settings menu

### Step 2: Enable Courses

You have multiple options for enabling courses:

#### Option A: Enable Individual Courses
- Check the box next to each course you want to enable
- Click **Toggle course** to activate selected courses

#### Option B: Enable All Courses
- Click **Select all** to choose all available courses
- This enables all standard courses included in your subscription

### Step 3: Apply Changes

## Premium Training Courses

### Viewing Premium Content

To see all available training courses, including premium content:
- Click **Show all courses** in the training settings

### Enabling Premium Courses

Premium training courses require an additional subscription:

1. Click **Enable in Billing** for premium course access
2. A checkbox will appear to confirm premium features
3. Review the additional costs associated with premium training

<Warning>
  Disabling premium training will immediately remove all premium courses from your tenant. Users will lose access to any in-progress premium training.
</Warning>

## Important Considerations

- **Immediate Effect**: Changes to training settings take effect immediately
- **User Impact**: Disabling courses removes them for all users in your organization
- **Progress Tracking**: User progress is maintained when re-enabling previously disabled courses
- **Billing**: Premium courses incur additional charges - review pricing before enabling
