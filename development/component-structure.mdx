# Component Structure

The MSP Checkmate application follows a feature-based component organization structure that aligns with the main navigation and business domains.

## Directory Structure

Components are organized into the following main categories:

### Feature Components

- **`company-overview/`** - Dashboard and company overview components
- **`surveys/`** - Survey management and analysis components
- **`goals/`** - Goals tracking and management
- **`planner/`** - Task planning and scheduling features
  - `timeline/` - Timeline view components
  - `list/` - List view components
  - `templates/` - Template management
  - `settings/` - Planner-specific settings
  - `report/` - Reporting components
- **`budgets/`** - Budget management
  - `builder/` - Budget creation and editing
- **`calendar/`** - Calendar and meeting management
  - `calendar-view/` - Calendar display components
  - `my-meetings/` - Personal meeting views
  - `list-view/` - Meeting list displays
  - `recurring-meetings/` - Recurring meeting management
  - `meetings/` - Core meeting components
- **`compliance/`** - Compliance tracking and management
  - `dashboard/` - Compliance overview
  - `runs/` - Compliance run execution
  - `history/` - Historical compliance data
  - `settings/` - Compliance configuration
- **`devices/`** - Device management components

### Settings Components

All settings-related components are organized under `settings/`:

- **`user-settings/`** - User profile and preferences
- **`users-roles/`** - User and role management
- **`companies/`** - Company configuration
- **`compliance/`** - Compliance settings (groups, checks, runs)
- **`status-lists/`** - Status list configuration
- **`note-templates/`** - Note template management
- **`playbooks/`** - Playbook configuration
- **`surveys/`** - Survey settings
- **`integrations/`** - Third-party integrations
- **`import-export/`** - Data import/export tools
- **`device-types/`** - Device type configuration
- **`tenant/`** - Tenant-level settings

### Shared Components

Common and cross-feature components are in `shared/`:

- **`filters/`** - Reusable filter components
- **`auth-layout/`** - Authentication layout components
- **`reporting/`** - Shared reporting components
- **`debug/`** - Debug and development tools
- **`common/`** - Common utility components (alerts, dialogs, etc.)

### UI Components

Base UI components remain in the `ui/` directory, following the shadcn/ui pattern.

## Import Examples

```typescript
// Feature components
import { DashboardCard } from '@/components/company-overview/DashboardCard'
import { PlannerTimeline } from '@/components/planner/timeline/PlannerTimeline'

// Settings components
import { UserSettings } from '@/components/settings/user-settings/UserSettings'
import { CompanyManager } from '@/components/settings/companies/CompanyManager'

// Shared components
import { FilterBar } from '@/components/shared/filters/FilterBar'
import { Alert } from '@/components/shared/common/Alert'

// UI components
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/card'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Feature Isolation**: Keep feature-specific components within their feature directory
2. **Shared Wisely**: Only move components to `shared/` if they're used across multiple features
3. **Settings Grouping**: All configuration UI belongs in `settings/`
4. **Maintain Hierarchy**: Use subdirectories for complex features with multiple views
5. **Consistent Naming**: Use PascalCase for component files and directories
