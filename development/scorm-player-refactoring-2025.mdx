## Technical Implementation Details

### SCORM Data Processing Architecture

The new SCORM commit API provides comprehensive data processing:

```typescript
// Enhanced CMI data extraction and normalization
function extractBookmarkFromCMI(cmi: any): string {
  const direct = cmi?.location ?? cmi?.core?.lesson_location ?? "";
  if (direct) return String(direct);
  return fallbackFromSuspendData(cmi?.suspend_data);
}

// Support for both SCORM 1.2 and 2004 formats
const scormData = {
  cmi: cmi || {},
  lesson_location: extractBookmarkFromCMI(cmi),
  completion_status: cmi.completion_status || cmi.core?.lesson_status,
  score_raw: cmi.score?.raw || cmi.core?.score?.raw
};
```

### Progress Calculation Logic

Enhanced progress tracking with multiple completion criteria:

```typescript
// Intelligent status determination
if (scormData.completion_status === "completed" || 
    scormData.lesson_status === "passed") {
  progress_percentage = 100;
  status = "completed";
} else if (scormData.progress_measure) {
  progress_percentage = Math.round(parseFloat(scormData.progress_measure) * 100);
  status = "in_progress";
}
```

### Time Tracking Implementation

Comprehensive time tracking for both SCORM versions:

```typescript
const scormTimeToSeconds = (timeString: string): number => {
  // SCORM 1.2 format: HH:MM:SS
  if (timeString.includes(":")) {
    const [hours, minutes, seconds] = timeString.split(":");
    return hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + parseFloat(seconds);
  }
  
  // SCORM 2004 format: PT1H30M45S (ISO 8601)
  if (timeString.startsWith("PT")) {
    // Parse ISO 8601 duration format
    return parseISODuration(timeString);
  }
};
```

## Security and Performance Enhancements

### Authentication and Authorization
- Enhanced user verification for all API endpoints
- Tenant isolation maintained across all operations
- Comprehensive enrollment ownership validation

### CORS and CSP Handling

- CSP bypass maintained for SCORM content serving
- Enhanced security without breaking SCORM functionality

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced payload sizes through efficient data structures
- Better caching strategies for SCORM content
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Improved error handling to reduce unnecessary processing

## Database Schema Considerations

### Enhanced Enrollment Tracking
- `scorm_last_location`: Fast access to learner position
- `time_spent_seconds`: Accurate time tracking
- `last_accessed_at`: Better session management
- `scorm_data`: Complete SCORM state preservation

### Course Metadata Enhancements

- Better categorization and filtering
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Improved reporting metrics

## Migration and Deployment Notes
