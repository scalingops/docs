# Ticket Details Modal Improvements

_Date: August 11, 2025_
_Version: Post-commit 9a03b8ed_

## Overview

Fixed critical issues with the TicketDetailsModal component that prevented proper opening and functionality on the `/tickets` page. The modal has been completely refactored from Sheet to Dialog components and enhanced with comprehensive ticket management features.

## Key Problems Resolved

### 1. Modal Opening Logic Fix
**Issue**: The modal was not opening properly when clicking on tickets in the tickets table.

**Root Cause**: The modal's `open` prop was set to `!!selectedTicket` but the logic was checking for `selectedTicketId`.

**Solution**: Changed the open prop from `!!selectedTicket` to `!!selectedTicketId` to match the state management logic.

```typescript
// Before (broken)
<TicketDetailsModal
  ticket={selectedTicket}
  open={!!selectedTicket}  // Wrong - checking ticket object
  onOpenChange={(open) => {
    if (!open) setSelectedTicketId(null);
  }}
/>

// After (fixed)
<TicketDetailsModal
  ticket={selectedTicket}
  open={!!selectedTicketId}  // Correct - checking ticket ID
  onOpenChange={(open) => {
    if (!open) setSelectedTicketId(null);
  }}
/>
```

### 2. Component Architecture Migration
**Issue**: Sheet components were not working properly in this project context.

**Solution**: Migrated from Sheet to Dialog components for better reliability and functionality.

```typescript
// Before (Sheet-based)
import { Sheet, SheetContent, SheetTitle } from "@/components/ui/sheet";

// After (Dialog-based)
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogDescription } from "@/components/ui/dialog";
```
