# AI Text Improvement

The AI Text Improvement feature helps MSP professionals quickly polish and professionalize their written content across all WYSIWYG editors in the application using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Overview

When writing reports, documentation, or client communications, maintaining a professional and consistent tone is crucial. The AI Text Improvement feature:

- **Rewrites text** for clarity, conciseness, and professionalism
- **Fixes grammar and spelling** automatically
- **Maintains technical accuracy** while improving readability
- **Preserves HTML structure** including headings, lists, and formatting
- **Uses active voice** and plain English for better comprehension

## Prerequisites

Before using the AI text improvement feature, ensure:
1. Your organization has configured an OpenAI API key
2. You have text content in a WYSIWYG editor
3. You have permission to use AI features

## Using AI Text Improvement

### Improving Your Text

1. Open any WYSIWYG editor in the application (reports, templates, notes, etc.)
2. Type or paste your draft text
3. Click the **Generate** button (star icon) in the editor toolbar
4. The AI will process and replace your text with an improved version
5. Review the improved text and make any necessary adjustments
6. Save your content

<Note>
The Generate button will pulse while processing and is disabled if no text is present in the editor.
</Note>

### What Gets Improved

The AI improvement process:
- **Clarifies ambiguous language** for better understanding
- **Removes redundancy** while preserving meaning
- **Corrects grammar and spelling** errors
- **Standardizes formatting** for consistency
- **Converts to active voice** where appropriate
- **Simplifies complex sentences** without losing technical accuracy
- **Maintains metric measurements** if mentioned in the text

## Example Transformations

### Before
```html
<p>The server's that we checked yesterday, they wasn't configured 
properly and this could of caused issues with the backups not 
running like they should be.</p>
```

### After
```html
<p>Yesterday's server inspection revealed improper configuration 
that prevented backups from running correctly.</p>
```

### Technical Documentation Example

**Before:**
```html
<p>We need to basically update the firewall rules because there's 
alot of ports that are opened that shouldn't be opened and this 
is a security risk for the company.</p>
```

**After:**
```html
<p>Update firewall rules to close unnecessary open ports and 
reduce security risk.</p>
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up OpenAI Integration

Add your OpenAI API key to your environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

<Warning>
Keep your OpenAI API key secure and never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### Model Configuration

The feature uses:
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini for fast, cost-effective processing
- **Temperature**: 0.3 for consistent, professional output
- **Max Tokens**: 2000 to handle longer text improvements

## System Prompt

The AI uses the following system prompt for text improvement:

```text
You are a senior technical writer for an MSP.
Rewrite any supplied text so it is clear, concise, and professional.
• Preserve intent and technical accuracy
• Fix grammar, spelling, and formatting
• Use active voice and plain English
• Keep measurements metric if mentioned
• Maintain any HTML structure (<h2>, <ul>, <p>, etc.) but add none that isn't needed
• No mention of AI, no apologies, no disclaimers
```

This prompt ensures:
- Professional MSP-appropriate language
- Technical accuracy preservation
- Clean output without AI artifacts
- HTML structure maintenance

## Best Practices

### Writing for AI Improvement

To get the best results:

1. **Include all key information** in your draft, even if roughly written
2. **Use HTML tags** for structure (headings, lists) if desired
3. **Don't worry about grammar** - focus on getting ideas down
4. **Be specific** about technical details that must be preserved

### Reviewing AI Output

Always review improved content for:

- **Accuracy** of technical information
- **Completeness** of your original message
- **Appropriate tone** for your audience
- **Client-specific terminology** that may need adjustment
- **Removal of any hallucinated content** not in your original

## Use Cases

### Report Writing
- Transform technical notes into executive summaries
- Polish draft reports before client delivery
- Standardize tone across team-written content

### Template Creation
- Improve template language for clarity
- Ensure consistent professional tone
- Remove ambiguity from instructions

### Client Communications
- Polish email drafts and responses
- Improve clarity of technical explanations
- Ensure professional tone in all communications

### Documentation
- Clean up internal documentation
- Improve readability of procedures
- Standardize writing style across documents

## Limitations

- Requires text content to improve (won't generate from scratch)
- Maximum input/output based on token limits
- May not preserve highly specialized formatting
- Client-specific terminology may need manual adjustment
- Requires stable internet connection for API calls

## Troubleshooting

### Generate Button Not Working

If the Generate button doesn't respond:
- Ensure you have text in the editor
- Check that your content isn't just empty HTML tags
- Verify you're not already processing (button will pulse)
- Check for error messages in toast notifications

### API Key Not Configured

If you see an API configuration error:
- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY is set in environment variables
- Restart the application after adding the key
- Check the key is valid and has available credits

### Poor Quality Output

If the improved text isn't satisfactory:
- Ensure your original text has clear intent
- Break very long content into smaller sections
- Add more context to ambiguous statements
- Review and manually adjust the output

### Content Not Replaced

If your original text remains unchanged:
- Check for error notifications
- Verify internet connectivity
- Ensure the API service is available
- Try with shorter text to test functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The AI text improvement feature uses:
- **Server Actions** for secure API communication
- **Dynamic imports** to avoid client-side bundle impact
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback
- **Loading states** with visual feedback (pulse animation)

### Security

- OpenAI API calls made server-side only
- API keys never exposed to client
- Input sanitization before processing
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Performance

- Processing typically takes 2-4 seconds
- Uses GPT-4o-mini for optimal speed/quality balance
- No impact on application performance when not in use
- Graceful degradation if API is unavailable
