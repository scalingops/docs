# AI Compliance Notes

The AI Compliance Notes feature helps vCIOs and technicians quickly generate professional, client-facing public notes from their technical private notes using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Overview

When working on compliance checks, technicians often need to maintain two sets of notes:

- **Private notes**: Technical details, internal observations, and detailed remediation steps
- **Public notes**: Professional, client-facing summaries written in business language

The AI Draft feature automates the creation of public notes by analyzing your private notes and generating professional summaries that:

- Use clear business language without technical jargon
- Focus on business impact and value
- Provide actionable remediation steps
- Maintain a professional tone without unnecessary pleasantries

## Prerequisites

Before using the AI compliance notes feature, ensure:

1. You have private notes written for the compliance check
2. You have permission to edit compliance checks

## Using AI Draft

### Generating Public Notes

1. Open a compliance check dialog
2. Navigate to the **Notes** section
3. Enter your technical observations in the **Private Notes** field
4. Click the **AI Draft** button next to Public Notes
5. The AI will generate professional public notes that stream in real-time
6. Review and edit the generated content as needed
7. Save the compliance check

<Note>
  The AI Draft button is only enabled when private notes are present, as it uses them as the source for generating public notes.

### Generated Content Format

The AI generates notes with:

- **Clear headers** using Markdown formatting
- **Bullet points** for easy scanning
- **Structured sections** for issue summary, impact, and remediation
- **Concise content** limited to approximately 120 words
- **Professional tone** without filler phrases or pleasantries

## Example Output

Given private notes about a firewall configuration issue, the AI might generate:

```markdown
## Security Configuration Review

Your network protection requires immediate attention to maintain security standards.

### Current Status
- Firewall rules not optimally configured
- Several unnecessary ports exposed
- Logging incomplete for audit requirements

### Business Impact
- Increased vulnerability to security threats
- Non-compliance with industry standards
- Potential data exposure risk

### Recommended Actions
- Update firewall ruleset to minimize exposure
- Enable comprehensive security logging
- Schedule quarterly security reviews
```

### Customizing the AI Behavior

The AI assistant is configured to:

- Generate content suitable for client communication
- Focus on business value and impact
- Avoid technical jargon
- Maintain a professional, direct tone
- Limit output to approximately 1000 words

These settings are optimized for MSP compliance reporting and cannot be customized per-user.

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Private Notes

To get the best results from AI generation:

1. **Be specific** about technical issues found
2. **Include context** about why issues matter
3. **Document remediation steps** you plan to take
4. **Note any risks or impacts** to the business

### Reviewing Generated Content

Always review AI-generated content before saving:

- **Verify accuracy** of technical details translated to business language
- **Ensure completeness** of recommendations
- **Check tone** is appropriate for the specific client
- **Add client-specific context** where needed
- **Remove any hallucinated information** that doesn't match your findings

## Limitations

- Maximum output length of approximately 1000 words
- Requires private notes to generate content
- Generated content should always be reviewed before client delivery
- AI may not capture client-specific terminology or preferences
- Real-time streaming requires stable internet connection

## Troubleshooting

### AI Draft Button Disabled

If the AI Draft button is disabled:

- Ensure you have entered private notes
- Check that you have edit permissions for the compliance check
- Verify the check is not in historical/read-only mode

### Generation Fails

If content generation fails:

- Ensure your internet connection is stable
- Try reducing the length of your private notes

### Content Not Appearing

If generated content doesn't appear immediately:

- The content streams in real-time - wait a few seconds
- Check for any error messages in the toast notification
- Refresh the dialog if the issue persists

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The AI compliance notes feature uses:

- **Server Actions** for secure API calls
- **Streaming responses** for real-time content display
- **Markdown to HTML conversion** for rich text formatting
- **Optimistic updates** for immediate UI feedback

### Security

- OpenAI API calls are made server-side only
- API keys are never exposed to the client
- Content is streamed through secure WebSocket connections
- All generated content is saved to your secure database

### Performance

- Streaming typically begins within 1-2 seconds
- Complete generation takes 3-5 seconds for 120 words
- Content updates are debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- Generated content is cached until the dialog is closed
