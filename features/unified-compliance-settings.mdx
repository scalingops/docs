# Unified Compliance Settings

The compliance settings have been consolidated into a single section with a dropdown menu for easy navigation between different compliance management areas.

## Accessing Compliance Settings

Navigate to **Settings â†’ Compliance** in the sidebar. This will take you to the unified compliance section.

## Navigation Menu

In the top-right corner of any compliance settings page, you'll find a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between:

- **Checks** - Manage individual compliance checks and standards
- **Groups** - Organize checks into logical groups
- **Runs** - Configure compliance run templates

## Default View

When you click on "Compliance" in the settings sidebar, you'll be automatically redirected to the Checks page, which serves as the main entry point for compliance configuration.

## URL Structure

The new URL structure follows this pattern:
- `/settings/compliance/checks` - Compliance Checks
- `/settings/compliance/groups` - Compliance Groups  
- `/settings/compliance/runs` - Compliance Runs

## Benefits

- **Simplified Navigation**: One sidebar entry instead of four separate ones
- **Consistent Interface**: All compliance settings share the same layout and navigation pattern
- **Quick Switching**: Easy access to related compliance settings without going back to the main settings page
