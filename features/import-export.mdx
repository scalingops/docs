# Import/Export Data

The import/export feature allows you to export your data in CSV format for backup, analysis, or migration purposes. You can also import data back into the system using the same CSV format.

## Accessing Import/Export

Navigate to **Settings → Import/Export** in the sidebar. You must have the appropriate permissions:
- **Export**: Requires `manage_settings_export` permission

## Supported Data Types

The following data types can be exported and imported:

- **Companies** - Organization information including contacts and settings

### Export File Format

Export files include:
- **IDs** - Unique identifiers for updating existing records

- **All Fields** - Complete data for each record

### File Naming Convention

Export files are named using this pattern:
```

```

For example: `devices_export_all_20250115.csv`

## Importing Data

## Best Practices

### Before Exporting

- Consider filtering by company to reduce file size
- Export regularly for backup purposes
- Review the data to ensure it contains what you expect

### Before Importing

- **Always backup first** - Export current data before importing
- **Test with small datasets** - Verify format with a few records
- **Check IDs** - Ensure IDs match existing records for updates
- **Validate relationships** - Confirm referenced companies/locations exist

### Data Integrity

- The system validates all data during import
- Foreign key relationships are checked
- Required fields must be present
- Data types must match expected formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Export Issues

**No data in export**
- Verify you have data for the selected company
- Check your permissions for the data type

**Export fails**
- Check the error message in history
- Verify your session hasn't expired

### Common Import Issues

**"No data found in CSV"**
- Ensure file is properly formatted CSV
- Check that file isn't empty
- Verify headers match template

**Records not importing**
- Missing required fields (e.g., company name/ID)
- Invalid foreign key references
- Incorrect data formats

**Updates not working**
- Verify IDs match existing records
- Check tenant isolation (can't update other tenants' data)
- Ensure update mode is selected

## Security Notes

- All operations respect tenant isolation
- Only your tenant's data can be accessed
- Exports include only data you have permission to view
- Imports validate ownership before updates
