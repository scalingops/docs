# M365 Secure Score and Planner Integration Enhancement

**Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement / Refactoring

## Overview

This update introduces significant improvements to the Microsoft 365 Secure Score module and enhances its integration with the Planner system. The changes include UI modernization, new server actions for secure score integration, and the removal of deprecated action-specific pages.

## Major Changes

### 1. M365 Secure Score Module Refactoring

#### Files Removed
- `app/(auth)/m365/secure-score/actions/ActionsTable.client.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/m365/secure-score/actions/BulkActionsToolbar.client.tsx` 
- `app/(auth)/m365/secure-score/actions/ControlDetails.client.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/m365/secure-score/actions/SecureScoreActionsClient.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/m365/secure-score/actions/page.tsx`

The dedicated `/actions` sub-page has been removed in favor of integrating actions directly into the main secure score page.

#### Main Secure Score Page Enhancement
- **File:** `app/(auth)/m365/secure-score/page.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Integrated actions table directly into the main page layout
  - Enhanced company context handling for both global and company-specific views
  - Improved M365 integration detection and messaging
  - Added comprehensive category breakdown with latest score data
  - Streamlined data loading with Promise.all for better performance

#### New Summary Cards Component
- **File:** `components/m365/secure-score/SecureScoreSummaryCards.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Displays current score, max score, and percentage
  - Industry comparison with differential display
  - 30-day trend analysis with visual indicators
  - Active vs licensed user metrics
  - Category breakdown with color-coded progress indicators
  - Responsive grid layout for different screen sizes

#### Sync Client Component Updates  
- **File:** `app/(auth)/m365/secure-score/SecureScoreOverviewClient.tsx`
- **Improvements:**
  - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
  - Better batch sync result processing
  - Improved loading states and success messaging
  - Auto-refresh after successful sync operations

### 2. Planner Integration with Secure Score

#### New Server Actions
- **File:** `app/actions/secure-score-planner.ts`
- **Purpose:** Bridge secure score controls with planner items
- **Key Functions:**
  - `getAvailableSecureScoreControlsAction()` - Fetches controls available for linking
  - `getLinkedSecureScoreDetailsAction()` - Retrieves details for already linked controls
  - Uses UUIDs for control identification instead of numeric IDs
  - Implements proper HTML sanitization for control descriptions

#### Enhanced Planner Types
- **File:** `types/planner.ts`
- **New Fields:**
  - `secure_score_json` - Array of linked secure score controls
  - `linked_secure_score_count` - Count of linked secure score controls
  - Added probability field for completion tracking

#### Planner Action Updates
- **File:** `app/actions/planner.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated to use new `v_planner_items_detailed` view
  - Integrated secure score data directly from database view
  - Simplified data fetching by leveraging view structure

#### Enhanced Hook Support
- **File:** `hooks/use-planner-item-actions.ts`
- **New Features:**
  - Added secure score control selection handlers
  - `handleSecureScoreSelect()` for adding controls to planner items
  - `handleRemoveSecureScore()` for removing linked controls
  - `isSecureScoreSelected()` helper for checking selection state
  - Proper data structure handling for secure score control objects

#### Updated Relationships Section
- **File:** `components/planner/planner-item-edit-dialog/RelationshipsSection.tsx`
- **Enhancements:**
  - Added secure score control linking UI
  - New "Add Secure Score" button with Shield icon
  - Support for displaying linked secure score controls
  - Integration with selection handlers from the hook

### 3. Package Dependencies

#### Dependency Updates
- **File:** `package.json`
- **Changes:**
  - Reorganized dependencies alphabetically
  - Moved `@tanstack/react-virtual` and `isomorphic-dompurify` to proper positions
  - Downgraded `next-video` from `^2.2.3` to `^0.0.1` (potential breaking change - needs verification)

### 4. Database Integration Improvements

#### View Integration
- Enhanced use of `v_secure_score_actions_needed` view for data fetching
- Leveraged `v_planner_items_detailed` view for comprehensive planner data
- Improved tenant-scoped data access patterns

#### UUID-Based Identification
- Migrated from numeric control IDs to UUID-based identification
- Better consistency across database operations
- Enhanced data integrity and referential consistency

## Technical Implementation Details

### HTML Sanitization
- Implemented `sanitizeAndConvertHTML()` for secure score control descriptions
- Prevents XSS attacks while preserving necessary formatting
- Applied consistently across all user-facing content

### Security Enhancements
- Proper tenant scoping on all database operations
- Authentication checks in all server actions
- Input validation and error handling improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- Use of Promise.all for concurrent data fetching
- Efficient data transformation and caching
- Optimized component re-rendering with memo usage

### User Experience Improvements
- Better error messaging and loading states
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Consistent styling with existing design system
- Improved navigation and workflow integration

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
1. **Streamlined UI:** Consolidated secure score interface reduces navigation complexity
2. **Enhanced Integration:** Direct planner-secure score linking improves workflow efficiency
3. **Better Performance:** Optimized data fetching and component structure
4. **Improved Security:** Enhanced HTML sanitization and validation
5. **Modern Architecture:** Better separation of concerns and code organization

### Potential Risks
1. **Breaking Change:** `next-video` downgrade may affect video functionality
2. **Migration Required:** Existing bookmarks to `/actions` page will be broken
3. **Data Dependencies:** Requires updated database views to function properly

### Migration Requirements
- Users accessing direct `/actions` URLs will need to use main secure score page
- Existing planner items may need data migration for secure score linkages
- Testing required for video-related functionality due to package downgrade

## Testing Requirements

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - Verify secure score data display and sync functionality
   - Test planner-secure score linking and unlinking
   - Confirm proper tenant scoping and permissions

2. **UI Testing:**
   - Responsive design validation across devices
   - Component interaction testing
   - Error state and loading state verification

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Database view compatibility
   - API endpoint functionality
   - Cross-component data flow

## Follow-up Actions

1. **Monitor:** Watch for issues related to `next-video` downgrade
2. **Document:** Update user documentation for new secure score workflow
3. **Migrate:** Consider data migration script for existing planner items
4. **Optimize:** Monitor performance metrics for new data fetching patterns
