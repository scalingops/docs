## Executive Summary

The MSPortal marketing website has undergone a complete transformation from a pre-launch waitlist collection site to a ready-to-use product presentation. This strategic shift repositions MSPortal as an available, AI-powered solution rather than an upcoming product, reflecting the product's readiness for market deployment.

## Key Changes Overview

### 1. Messaging Transformation

### 2. Call-to-Action (CTA) Updates
