   - Provides consistent header styling for the support page
   - Props: `title` and `description`
   - Location: `D:\git\checkmate-main\components\help-support\SupportPageHeader.tsx`

2. **SupportRequestCard.tsx**
   - Handles support request functionality
   - Integrates with support form components
   - Location: `D:\git\checkmate-main\components\help-support\SupportRequestCard.tsx`

3. **SupportResourcesCard.tsx**
   - Displays available support resources
   - Provides links to documentation and help materials
   - Location: `D:\git\checkmate-main\components\help-support\SupportResourcesCard.tsx`

4. **SupportRequestForm.client.tsx**
   - Client-side form component for support requests
   - Handles form validation and submission
   - Location: `D:\git\checkmate-main\components\help-support\SupportRequestForm.client.tsx`

#### Refactored Help & Support Page

The main help-support page (`app/(auth)/help-support/page.tsx`) was significantly simplified:

**Before:** Complex monolithic component with embedded logic
**After:** Clean, modular component using dedicated components

```tsx
export default function HelpSupportPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-6 space-y-6">
      <SupportPageHeader
        title="Help & Support"
        description="Get help with using MSPortal or contact our support team"
      />
      <div className="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2">
        <SupportRequestCard />
        <SupportResourcesCard />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Improved maintainability** - Components are now isolated and testable
- **Better performance** - Reduced bundle size through code splitting
- **Enhanced reusability** - Components can be used in other contexts
- **Cleaner architecture** - Separation of concerns between layout and functionality

### Ticket System Improvements

#### Enhanced Ticket Actions (`app/actions/tickets.ts`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Expanded ticket creation functionality** with better validation
- **Enhanced error handling** throughout the ticket workflow
- **Improved template handling** for ticket creation
- **Better PSA provider integration** with standardized interfaces

**New Functions Added:**
- Enhanced `createTicketAction` with better validation and error handling
- Improved PSA provider detection and handling
- Better template processing and application

#### New Ticket Details Modal Wrapper

**Component:** `TicketDetailsModalWrapper.tsx`
**Purpose:** Optimize ticket details loading and user experience

**Key Features:**
- **Pre-fetches complete ticket data** before opening modal
- **Provider-aware data loading** (ConnectWise, Halo, Syncro)
- **Graceful error handling** with fallback to basic data
- **Performance optimization** through data caching

**Implementation Highlights:**
```tsx
// Pre-fetch complete ticket data when requested to open
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    if (open && ticket && !isLoading && !completeData) {
      const provider = getProvider(ticket);
      const result = await getCompleteTicketData(
        ticket.ticket_id,
        ticket.integration_id || "",
        provider,
        ticket.board_external_id || undefined
      );
      // Handle data merging and modal opening
    }
  };
  fetchData();
}, [open, ticket, getProvider]);
```

#### PSA Provider Enhancements

**ConnectWise Adapter (`lib/psa/adapters/connectwise/tickets.ts`)**
- Enhanced ticket data fetching with better error handling
- Improved status mapping and field normalization

**Halo Adapter (`lib/psa/adapters/halo/tickets.ts`)**

- Enhanced ticket note handling and synchronization
- Better error handling for API failures

**Syncro Adapter (`lib/psa/adapters/syncro/tickets.ts`)**
- Improved ticket creation and update workflows
- Enhanced asset linking and customer management
- Better handling of Syncro-specific field mappings

### AppDataProvider Enhancements

#### Improved Authentication Flow (`contexts/AppDataProvider.server.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Enhanced refresh token handling** with multiple error code support
- **Better session expiration management** with graceful fallbacks
- **Improved error classification** for different auth failure scenarios

**Enhanced Error Handling:**
```tsx
const refreshTokenInvalid =
  isRefreshTokenInvalid || messageIndicatesInvalidRefreshToken;

if (refreshTokenInvalid) {
  try {
    // Graceful session cleanup
    await supabase.auth.signOut();
  } catch (signOutError) {
    // Handle signout errors gracefully
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

   - Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
   - Better user feedback through improved error messaging

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Help & Support components load only when needed
   - Ticket details data fetched on-demand
   - Reduced initial bundle size through code splitting

2. **Caching Improvements**
   - Better cache management for ticket data
   - Optimized re-validation strategies
   - Reduced API calls through intelligent caching

3. **Memory Management**
