# Company Scoping Consistency Fixes - September 15, 2025

**Date:** 2025-09-15
**Version:** 1.1
**Type:** Bug Fix & Enhancement
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

This update addresses consistency issues in company scoping behavior across different UI components and improves the integration between server-side filtering and client-side component logic. The changes ensure that data filtering works correctly in all three scoping modes: Global View, Single Company View, and Assigned Companies View.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Inconsistent Client-Side Filtering Logic

**Problem**: Client-side components were applying different filtering logic than what was being implemented on the server side, leading to data display inconsistencies.

**Components Affected**:
- `ComplianceIssuesCard.tsx`
- `PlannerItemsCard.tsx`
- `RecentRunsCard.tsx`
- `SummaryCards.tsx`

**Previous Logic**:
```typescript
// Inconsistent filtering - inverse logic
const scoped = isGlobalView || companyScope === "assigned"
  ? items  // No filtering for global/assigned
  : items.filter((item) => item.company_id === selectedCompany?.id); // Filter only for single
```

**Updated Logic**:
```typescript
// Consistent filtering - only filter in single company mode
const scoped = companyScope === "single" && selectedCompany?.id
  ? items.filter((item) => item.company_id === selectedCompany.id)
  : items; // For "global" and "assigned", data is already filtered server-side
```

### 2. Calendar Pages Missing Assigned Companies Support

**Problem**: Calendar pages were not properly handling the assigned companies scope mode, only supporting single company and global views.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(auth)/calendar/page.tsx`
- `app/(auth)/calendar/list/page.tsx`

**Changes Made**:
1. **Updated scope extraction**: Changed from destructuring `companyId` to getting full `scope` object
2. **Enhanced server queries**: Added support for `companyIds` parameter in meeting fetching
3. **Improved filtering logic**: Now properly handles all three scope modes

### 3. Server Query Function Enhancement

**Problem**: The `fetchMeetingsServer` function only supported single company filtering, missing assigned companies functionality.

**File Modified**: `lib/supabase/queries.server.ts`

**Enhancements**:
1. **New Parameter**: Added `companyIds?: string[]` parameter for assigned companies filtering
2. **Enhanced Filtering Logic**:
   ```typescript
   // Filter by single company if provided
   if (companyId) {
     q = q.eq("company_id", companyId);
   }
   // Filter by multiple companies if provided (for assigned scope)
   else if (companyIds && companyIds.length > 0) {
     q = q.in("company_id", companyIds);
   }
   ```
3. **Updated Caching**: Modified cache key to include `companyIds` for proper cache invalidation

## Technical Details

### Calendar Page Updates

#### Before:
```typescript
const { companyId } = await getCompanyScopeFromCookies(cookieStore);
// ...
fetchMeetingsServer(tenantId, companyId ?? undefined, cookieStore)
```

#### After:
```typescript
const scope = await getCompanyScopeFromCookies(cookieStore);
// ...
fetchMeetingsServer(
  tenantId,
  scope.scope === "single" ? scope.companyId ?? undefined : undefined,
  scope.scope === "assigned" ? scope.companyIds : undefined,
  cookieStore
)
```

### Component Context Integration

All updated components now properly use the `companyScope` value from `useCompanyContext()`:

```typescript
const { selectedCompany, isGlobalView, companyScope } = useCompanyContext();
```

This ensures consistent behavior across all scoping modes and eliminates the logic inconsistencies that were causing display issues.

## Data Flow Improvements

### Server-Side Filtering Priority

The changes establish a clear hierarchy for data filtering:

1. **Server-Side First**: Data is filtered at the database level based on scope
   - Global: No company filtering applied
   - Single: Filtered to specific `company_id`
   - Assigned: Filtered to list of assigned `company_ids`

2. **Client-Side Minimal**: Client components only apply additional filtering for single company mode
   - Reduces redundant processing
   - Ensures consistency with server-side logic
   - Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary filtering

### Scope Detection Consistency

All affected pages now use the same pattern for scope detection:

```typescript
const scope = await getCompanyScopeFromCookies(cookieStore);
```

This provides access to the complete scope object including:
- `scope`: The current scope mode ("global", "single", "assigned")
- `companyId`: The selected company ID (for single mode)
- `companyIds`: Array of assigned company IDs (for assigned mode)

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Data Consistency
- All components now show the same filtered data set based on selected scope
- Eliminates confusion where different cards showed different company data
- Ensures compliance with user permissions and company assignments

### 2. Calendar Functionality
- Assigned companies scope now works properly in calendar views
- Meeting data correctly filters based on user's assigned companies
- Calendar blocks respect company scoping rules

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Reduced client-side filtering overhead
- Better cache utilization with improved cache keys
- Fewer unnecessary database queries

## Testing Verification

### Test Scenarios Covered

1. **Global View**: Verify all components show data from all companies
2. **Single Company View**: Confirm filtering to selected company only
3. **Assigned Companies View**: Validate data shows only from assigned companies
4. **Calendar Integration**: Test meeting filtering across all scope modes
5. **Component Consistency**: Ensure all overview cards show same scope data

### Regression Testing

- Existing functionality unchanged for users with single company access
- Company user restrictions still properly enforced
- Impersonation scenarios continue to work correctly
- Permission-based access controls remain intact

## Deployment Notes

### Database Impact
- No database schema changes required
- Existing indexes on `company_id` columns continue to be effective
- Query performance maintained through proper filtering

### Cache Considerations
- Updated cache keys ensure proper invalidation when switching scopes
- No manual cache clearing required during deployment
- Cache tags remain unchanged for existing functionality

### Browser Compatibility
- No client-side changes affecting browser compatibility
- Cookie handling remains unchanged
- JavaScript bundle size impact minimal

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Query Optimization**: Consider database view creation for complex multi-company queries
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implement more sophisticated caching for assigned companies data
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics tracking for scope-based query performance

### API Consistency
Future public API development should follow the same scoping patterns established in this update for consistency across the application.
