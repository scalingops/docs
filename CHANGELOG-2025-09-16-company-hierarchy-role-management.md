# Company Hierarchy and Role Management System Enhancement

**Date:** September 16, 2025
**Version:** v1.2.0
**Type:** Major Feature Enhancement

## Executive Summary

This release introduces a comprehensive company hierarchy and role management system that enables parent-child company relationships with sophisticated scoping and impersonation capabilities. The enhancement allows parent company users to manage and view their own company alongside all child companies, with selective impersonation capabilities for users within the company hierarchy.

## Key Business Value

- **Hierarchical Company Management**: Parent companies can now manage multiple child companies through a unified interface
- **Selective View Controls**: Users can switch between Global View (parent + children), individual company views, or filtered child company views
- **Enhanced Impersonation**: Parent company administrators can impersonate users within child companies for support and management purposes
- **Improved User Experience**: Streamlined interface with contextual company switching and responsive design improvements

## Major Features Added

### 1. Company Hierarchy System

#### Parent-Child Company Relationships
- Enhanced database schema to support `parent_company_id` relationships
- New database view `v_company_hierarchy` for efficient hierarchy queries
- Bulk parent company assignment capabilities through `BulkSetParentDialog` component

#### Company Scoping Enhancements
- **Global View**: Shows parent company + all child companies (for parent company users)
- **Assigned View**: Shows only child companies (for parent company users) or assigned companies (for tenant users)
- **Single View**: Focus on individual company data

```typescript
// New company scope types
type CompanyScope = "global" | "assigned" | "single";

// Enhanced AppDataProvider context
interface AppDataContextValue {
  isParentCompany?: boolean;
  childCompanyIds?: string[];
  companyScope: CompanyScope;
  assignedCompanyIds: string[];
}
```

### 2. Enhanced CompanySelector Component

#### Hierarchical Navigation
- **Parent Company Users**: Can switch between their company and child companies
- **Tenant Users**: Traditional global/individual company switching
- **Child Company Grouping**: Child companies are visually grouped and searchable
- **Global View Option**: "Global View (Parent + Children)" for comprehensive oversight

#### Key UI Improvements
- Responsive search functionality with real-time filtering
- Clear visual separation between parent and child companies
- Company count indicators for bulk views
- Improved mobile responsiveness with proper truncation

### 3. Advanced Impersonation System

#### Enhanced Permission Checking
```typescript
// Improved permission validation in impersonation actions
const { data: hasPermission } = await supabase
  .from("role_permissions")
  .select("permission_id")
  .eq("role_id", userProfile.role_id)
  .eq("permission_id", "68ace0a5-d9ca-4dbd-8266-1bcac312b257") // impersonate:start
  .single();
```

#### Company-Aware Impersonation
- Automatic company scope synchronization when impersonating company users
- Enhanced impersonation context with company hierarchy awareness
- Improved session management with proper cookie handling

#### Direct Impersonation from Company Management
- Added impersonation capabilities directly in `CompanyUsersManager`
- One-click user impersonation with proper permission checks
- Enhanced user interface with impersonation status indicators

### 4. Enhanced Role Management System

#### Bulk Operations
- Bulk user role assignment across multiple users
- Bulk company parent assignment capabilities
- Enhanced data table with multi-select functionality

#### Improved User Management Interface
- Enhanced `CompanyRoleManager` with better responsive design
- Improved `UserMultiSelect` component with better accessibility
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Enhancements

#### New Views and Functions
```sql
-- New view for company hierarchy queries
CREATE VIEW v_company_hierarchy AS
SELECT
  c.*,
  p.name as parent_company_name,
  COUNT(children.id) as child_count
FROM companies c
LEFT JOIN companies p ON c.parent_company_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN companies children ON children.parent_company_id = c.id
GROUP BY c.id, p.name;
```

#### Enhanced Company Actions
- `getChildCompaniesAction()`: Retrieve child companies for a parent
- `getCompanyHierarchyAction()`: Fetch complete company hierarchy
- `setParentCompanyAction()`: Assign parent-child relationships
- `bulkSetParentCompanyAction()`: Bulk parent company assignment

### AppDataProvider Enhancements

#### Server-Side Context Detection
```typescript
// Enhanced server-side context detection
const isParentCompany = Boolean(
  userProfile?.company_id &&
  childCompanyIds?.length > 0
);

// Child company ID resolution
const childCompanyIds = userProfile?.company_id
  ? await getChildCompaniesForUser(userProfile.company_id)
  : [];
```

#### Client-Side State Management
- Improved hydration handling to prevent client-server mismatches
- Enhanced state synchronization between server and client contexts
- Better error handling for company scope transitions

### Middleware Enhancements

#### Enhanced Impersonation Enforcement
- Improved company scope cookie synchronization during impersonation
- Better handling of impersonated user company context
- Enhanced security for company-scoped operations

#### Cookie Management
```typescript
// Improved company scope cookie handling
if (targetCompanyId && existing !== targetCompanyId) {
  response.cookies.set("current_company_id", targetCompanyId, {
    path: "/",
    sameSite: "lax",
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: true,
  });
}
```
