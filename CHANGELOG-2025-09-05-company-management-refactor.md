# Company Management System Refactor - September 5, 2025

## Overview

Major refactoring of the company management system focusing on role management, Microsoft 365 integration improvements, and enhanced user experience across company-related features.

## Key Changes

### 1. Company Role Management Refactoring

#### Component Restructuring
- **Deleted**: `CompanyRolesManager.client.tsx` (380 lines removed)
- **Created**: `CompanySecurityRolesManager.client.tsx` (380 lines added)
- **Enhanced**: `CompanyRoleManager.client.tsx` (103 lines modified)

#### New Architecture
- Separated security role management from user role assignment
- `CompanySecurityRolesManager` handles creation, editing, and deletion of role definitions
- `CompanyRoleManager` focuses on assigning users to existing roles
- Improved permission checking with better error handling and user feedback

#### Key Features
- Clear separation between global (system) and custom (tenant-specific) company roles
- Enhanced role creation with display group assignment
- Better error handling and loading states
- Comprehensive permission validation using `hasPermission()` from AppDataProvider

### 2. Microsoft 365 Integration Enhancements

#### Callback Route Improvements (283 lines added/modified)
- **Enhanced error handling** with more descriptive error messages
- **Admin consent flow support** - handles both code flow and admin consent flow
- **Improved tenant information retrieval** using client credentials flow
- **Better state parameter validation**
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging integration issues

#### Key Improvements
- Support for `admin_consent=True` parameter in OAuth flow
- Client credentials flow for retrieving tenant information without user tokens
- Better error messages for missing parameters
- Enhanced organization data fetching from Microsoft Graph API

#### Integration Management
- Added `removeCompanyM365IntegrationAction()` for removing M365 integrations
- Proper revalidation of paths and cache tags after integration changes
- Enhanced integration status checking

### 3. Server Action Improvements

#### Consistent Tenant ID Handling
Multiple server actions were enhanced with proper tenant_id validation:
- `company-management.ts`: Added M365 integration removal
- `company-users.ts`: Enhanced user management with tenant scoping
- `deviceTypes.ts`: Improved device type management
- `templates.ts`: Enhanced template operations
- `companyRoles.ts`: Better role management with tenant isolation

#### Common Pattern
All actions now follow the consistent pattern:
```typescript
const profile = await getCurrentUserProfile();
if (!profile.tenant_id || !profile.userId) {
  throw new Error("Unauthorized");
}
```

### 4. Budget Management UX Improvements

#### Budget Line Item Enhancement (210 lines added)
- **Inline editing capabilities** - double-click to edit fields directly
- **Enhanced category options** aligned with products page
- **Better validation feedback** with visual indicators
- **Improved dropdown selections** with more relevant categories

#### Categories Updated
New category options include:
- Software, Hardware, Managed Services, Block Time
- Security, Productivity, Infrastructure, Compliance
- Training, Communication, Development, Workstations
- Networking, Miscellaneous, Other

#### UX Improvements
- Inline field editing with temporary value handling
- Better visual feedback for validation errors
- Enhanced dropdown menus with consistent styling

### 5. Component and Dialog Improvements

#### Device Type Management
