SELECT c.*, e.enrolled_at, p.progress_percentage, p.completed_at
FROM training_courses c
JOIN training_enrollments e ON c.id = e.course_id  
LEFT JOIN training_progress p ON c.id = p.course_id AND p.user_id = e.user_id
WHERE e.user_id = $1 AND c.tenant_id = $2;

-- Get compliance status by department
SELECT d.name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT ta.user_id) as assigned_users,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN tp.completed_at IS NOT NULL THEN ta.user_id END) as completed_users
