## Compliance Structure

### Hierarchy Overview
The compliance system follows a hierarchical structure:

```
Company
└── Compliance Run
    ├── Groups (Optional)
    │   ├── Company-Wide Checks
    │   ├── Device Checks
    │   └── Location Checks
    └── Ungrouped Checks
        ├── Company-Wide Checks
        ├── Device Checks
        └── Location Checks
```

### Target Types
Each compliance check can be assigned to different scope levels:
- **Company**: Organization-wide policies and procedures
- **Device**: Specific device or endpoint requirements
- **Location**: Physical location security and controls

## Compliance Checks

### Check Properties
Each compliance check includes:
- **Title**: Clear, actionable check name
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the requirement
- **How to Check**: Step-by-step verification instructions
- **Why Important**: Business justification and risk context
- **Criticality**: Numerical importance rating (1-10)
- **Priority**: High, Medium, or Low classification
- **Remediation**: Steps to resolve non-compliance
- **Remediation Impact**: Potential effects of remediation
- **References**: External documentation or standards

### Check Types
Currently supported check categories:
- **Device Security**: Endpoint configuration and security settings
- **Location Security**: Physical security controls and assessments
- **Company Policies**: Organization-wide policies and procedures
- **Control Frameworks**: Security control implementations

<Note>
The system currently focuses on general security compliance checks. Specific framework support (like CIS Benchmarks) is included through imported check libraries rather than automated scanning.
</Note>

## Compliance Runs

### Creating a Run
<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Run">
    Create a new compliance run for a company
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Checks">
    Choose which compliance checks to include
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Targets">
    Specify devices, locations, or company-wide scope
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Due Dates">
    Establish timeline for check completion
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Assessment">
    Perform manual verification of each check
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Run Management
- **Name**: Descriptive identifier for the run
- **Company**: Target organization being assessed
- **Run Date**: When the assessment was initiated
- **Status**: Active or completed state
- **Progress**: Percentage of checks completed

### Check Status Options
Each check within a run can have various statuses:
- **Pass**: Requirement met successfully
- **Fail**: Non-compliant with requirement
- **In Progress**: Currently being assessed
- **Not Applicable**: Check doesn't apply to this context
- **Pending**: Awaiting assessment

## Compliance Groups

### Group Organization
Groups provide logical organization for related checks:
- Create custom groups based on your needs
- Auto-map groups to device types for consistency
- Assign multiple checks to each group
- Track group-level completion metrics

### Group Types
- **Manual Groups**: Custom organizational groupings
- **Auto-Mapped Groups**: Automatically applied based on device type
- **Framework Groups**: Organized by compliance framework (when applicable)

### Managing Groups
- Create groups through Settings → Compliance → Groups
- Assign checks to groups during run creation
- View grouped vs ungrouped checks in the tree view
- Track completion by group for better visibility

## Notes and Documentation

### Note Types
- **Public Notes**: Visible to clients and stakeholders
- **Private Notes**: Internal documentation and observations
- **AI-Generated Notes**: Assisted documentation creation

### Documentation Features
- Rich text formatting for detailed notes
- Timestamp tracking for all updates
- User attribution for accountability
- Template support for consistent documentation

## Progress Tracking

### Metrics Available
- **Total Checks**: Number of checks in the run
- **Completed**: Checks with final status
- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of passing checks
- **Outstanding**: Checks pending completion
- **Past Due**: Checks beyond their due date

### Views
- **Tree View**: Hierarchical organization by company → run → group → check
- **List View**: Flat table view with filtering and sorting
- **Dashboard Cards**: Summary metrics on company overview
